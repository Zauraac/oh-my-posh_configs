# Oh-My-Posh Config
This is just a personal, quick access repo to pull configs for machines without having to deal too hard with Git authentication. 

You can safely ignore it or pull some of the configs if you want, the floor is yours! 

I am not in any way claiming ownership of the JSON configs that I haven't made from the ground up.

Cheers lads!
